The database in mongodb atlas cloud has been wiped out for unknown reason, so the application is no longer working but it is still well made. If I manage to update the database in future, I will update it here that application is working.

## Installation
1. Download and install mongodb(Community version)
2. Run command `npm install -g vue-cli`
3. Run command `npm install`

## Running application
Server and client can be started by one command, just type the following command from the root of this project
`npm run dev` 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 and nodemon for server
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

## Using application
Open your browser and goto link `localhost:8080` and you should see vue js documentation links. Goto link `localhost:8080/posts`, where you can add, edit and delete the post which will be stored in your db. Visit link `localhost:8081/posts`, this is where your api is being hosted.
